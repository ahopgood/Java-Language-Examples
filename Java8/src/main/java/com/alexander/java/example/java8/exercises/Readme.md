A series of interview style exercises with Java 8 and pre Java 8 solutions

## Factorial
A factor of a number x is a number that can be multiplied by another number to give you x, for example `x = 15` so the numbers **5** and **3** are factors of 15: `5 * 3 = 15`.    
The factorial of x is generated by multiplication of factors in the range 1 to x, this is written as x factorial or x!.    
The factorial of 0 (0!) is `0`  
The factorial of 1 (1!) is `1`  
The factorial of 3 (3!) for example would be `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`   
The factorial of 6 (6!) would be `1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720`  

Write a recursive program to calculate factorials.  
Write a procedural program to calculate factorials.  
Write the recursive solution using Java 8 streams and lambdas.
